# Action Scheduler CLI

_Due to two years of negligence and low prioritization on [improving the WP CLI](https://github.com/woocommerce/action-scheduler/issues/265) and [the PRs submitted](https://github.com/woocommerce/action-scheduler/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22component%3A+wp-cli%22+author%3Acrstauf) to [Action Scheduler](https://github.com/woocommerce/action-scheduler), got tired of waiting and created this plugin to optimize my use (and hopefully yours) of [Action Scheduler](https://actionscheduler.org/)._
